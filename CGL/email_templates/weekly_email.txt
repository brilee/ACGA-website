The next CGL round is scheduled for Saturday, {{next_round.date}} at 1pm EST/10am PST. Your team should log onto the accounts we have provided and be ready to go at 12:45pm EST in the Collegiate Go League room on KGS. If you've lost track of your login information, we can reset it for you.

{{season.name}}
    {% for match in next_round.match_set.all %}
    {{match.display_match}}
    {% endfor %}

    {% if next_round.bye_set %}
The following schools get a bye:
{% for bye in next_round.bye_set.all %} {{bye.team.school.name}}{% if forloop.last %}.{% else %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

{% endwith %}
{% endfor %}

If your school cannot compete this Saturday, please let us know ASAP!

Good luck to all teams.
