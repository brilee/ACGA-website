Hi everyone,

Games have been uploaded for the most recent round ({{previous_round_date}}). (If you rescheduled your match, send us an email after those games have been played so that we can upload them.)

{% for season in current_seasons %}
{{season.name}}
    {% for match in season.round_set.get_previous_round.match_set.all %}
    {{match.display_result}}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Full results and game records can be found here:

The next CGL round is scheduled for Saturday, {{next_round_date}} at 1pm EST/10am PST. Your team should log onto the accounts we have provided and be ready to go at 12:45pm EST in the Collegiate Go League room on KGS. If you've lost track of your login information, we can reset it for you.

The following schools are matched (KGS account name prefix in parentheses):

{% for season in current_seasons %}
{% with next_round=season.round_set.get_next_round %}
{{season.name}}
    {% for match in next_round.match_set.all %}
    {{match.display_match}}
    {% endfor %}

    {% if next_round.bye_set %}
The following schools get a bye:
{% for bye in next_round.bye_set.all %} {{bye.team.school.name}}{% if forloop.last %}.{% else %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

{% endwith %}
{% endfor %}

If your school cannot compete this Saturday, please let us know ASAP!

Good luck to all teams.
