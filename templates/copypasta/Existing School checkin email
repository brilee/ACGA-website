Hi,

It's that time of year again - checking in on everyone to see how they're doing. If anything has changed with your Go club's details - new location, new meeting time, new leadership, new website, not active anymore - let me know and I'll update the listing on our ACGA page (https://college-go.org/CGL/schools)

If you're interested in competing in the CGL this year, let me know! The only changes this season are for eligibility - we've decided to restrict CGL teams to current undergrads and grad students only.
