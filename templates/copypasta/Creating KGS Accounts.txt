Procedure for Creating New KGS Accounts for Schools
...................................................
KGS accounts must be 1-10 letters/numbers long. Must start with a letter. If a school's name is too long to fit, abbreviate it.

Format of account name should be:
[schoolnameprefix][number]

For example:
Brown1
MIT5
Northeast3

Register this account to cgl.tournament.director@gmail.com. 

Log onto the account with the new password to verify it. Then, edit personal info to not display rank, and put "college-go.org" in the info. Also, change the password to something besides the default.

Then, go to Rooms -> Tournament -> Join Collegiate Go League.
