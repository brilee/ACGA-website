Email Template For Sending Schools Login Credentials
-----------------------------------------------------
Hi [first name of recipient],

The login credentials for [school]'s CGL team are as follows:

Username base: [school username base]
Password base: [school password base]

Add a 1, 2, or 3 to the end of both the username and password for each corresponding board (so the first board would be [username]1 and [password]1).

Please have your players get familiar with logging in and using KGS before the first round. Let me know if you run into any issues!
