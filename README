Requirements:

Hi, and welcome to the ACGA website backend.

This site is written in Django. Google for an introduction/tutorial.

Git repository is hosted at github.com/brilee/ACGA-website

To run locally:
pip install -r requirements.pip
python manage.py create_test_db
python manage.py runserver

To change the season displayed on the website, use the django web interface at /admin. The entire site relies on this setting to determine what to show in recent/upcoming matches sidebar, results page, and a few other miscellaneous places.
